## 🎯 Overview

This repository contains the **ISOM Department's Faculty Performance Standards Framework**—a comprehensive, web-based resource that defines baseline expectations and SMART goals for faculty evaluation at Suffolk University's Sawyer Business School.

The framework was developed during AY 2025-26 as a pilot initiative to bring clarity, equity, and transparency to faculty performance evaluation, while honoring the diverse contributions of our faculty across teaching, scholarship, and service.

## 🔍 The Challenge

Higher education is navigating unprecedented change. At Suffolk University and the Sawyer Business School, like many institutions, we faced several interconnected challenges:

### The Evaluation Clarity Problem

For years, faculty performance reviews lacked clear, shared criteria. Associate Dean Tracey Riley articulated this challenge in her June 2025 communication:

> *"I've spoken openly about the challenges of this process, particularly the difficulty of evaluating without established, faculty-approved criteria."*

This ambiguity created:
- **Uncertainty** for faculty about what "meets expectations" actually means
- **Inconsistency** in how different departments and chairs evaluated similar work
- **Frustration** when ratings didn't align with faculty self-perceptions
- **Missed opportunities** for meaningful professional development conversations

### The SMART Goals Initiative

In response, SBS introduced a new SMART goals framework with a two-track evaluation system:

| Track | Purpose | Outcome |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Baseline** | Meet expectations in Teaching, Scholarship, and Service | COLA eligibility |
| **Merit** | Achieve ambitious SMART goals beyond baseline | Rating of 4 or 5 |

But this raised new questions: *What exactly does "meets expectations" mean in each area? How do we ensure equity across departments? How do we honor diverse forms of faculty contribution?*

### ISOM's Response

Rather than wait for top-down answers, the **Information Systems & Operations Management (ISOM) Department** took initiative to develop a thoughtful, faculty-centered framework that:

- ✅ Defines clear baseline expectations
- ✅ Provides multiple pathways for scholarship
- ✅ Aligns with AACSB accreditation standards
- ✅ Maintains equity with other SBS departments
- ✅ Creates meaningful distinction between baseline and merit-worthy work

---

## 💡 Our Approach

### Guiding Principles

We built this framework on six core principles:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **AACSB-Aligned** | Criteria reflect AACSB standards for faculty qualification and intellectual contributions |
| **Role-Appropriate** | Expectations vary by appointment type (SA vs. PA qualification) |
| **Context-Sensitive** | Evaluation considers circumstances while maintaining consistent standards |
| **Multi-Year Perspective** | Scholarly productivity assessed over 2-3 year trajectory, not annual checklist |
| **Equity Across SBS** | Standards consistent with other departments (using Marketing's benchmark) |
| **Clear Distinction** | Baseline performance distinguishable from merit-worthy achievement |

### The Three Pathways Model

Recognizing that faculty contribute in different ways, we established **three distinct pathways** for demonstrating scholarly engagement:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     SCHOLARSHIP PATHWAYS                            │
├─────────────────┬─────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┤
│    PATHWAY A    │     PATHWAY B       │        PATHWAY C            │
│    Research     │ Teaching Scholarship│    Practice Academic        │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
│ Traditional     │ Scholarship of      │ Professional                │
│ disciplinary    │ teaching and        │ engagement for              │
│ research for    │ learning for        │ PA-qualified                │
│ SA-qualified    │ SA-qualified        │ faculty                     │
│ faculty         │ faculty             │                             │
├─────────────────┼─────────────────────┼─────────────────────────────┤
│ 1-2 outputs     │ 1-2 outputs in      │ ~7-10 hours/week            │
│ over 2-3 years  │ teaching scholarship│ discipline-relevant         │
│                 │ over 2-3 years      │ professional activity       │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘
```

This model:
- **Validates teaching scholarship** as a legitimate form of intellectual contribution
- **Accommodates practitioner faculty** with appropriate standards
- **Aligns with AACSB** frameworks for faculty qualification
- **Provides flexibility** while maintaining rigor
