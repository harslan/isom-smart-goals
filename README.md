## Why We Built This

When the Sawyer Business School asked departments to define "meets expectations" criteria for the new SMART Goals initiative, ISOM saw an opportunity—not just to comply, but to build something useful.

Faculty across SBS were asking the same questions:

- *What exactly does "meets expectations" mean?*
- *How do I know if my work qualifies?*
- *What's the difference between baseline and merit-worthy?*

Rather than answer these questions one conversation at a time, we developed a clear framework. And because other departments might be wrestling with similar questions, we're sharing it openly.

## The Framework at a Glance

### Three Evaluation Areas

| Area | Baseline Expectation |
|------|---------------------|
| **Teaching** | Consistently effective instruction, professional development |
| **Scholarship** | 1-2 outputs over 2-3 years (via one of three pathways) |
| **Service** | Active participation in committees and department activities |

### Three Scholarship Pathways

We recognize that faculty contribute in different ways:

| Pathway | For | Expectation |
|---------|-----|-------------|
| **A: Research** | SA-qualified faculty | 1-2 traditional scholarly outputs over 2-3 years |
| **B: Teaching Scholarship** | SA-qualified faculty | 1-2 teaching scholarship outputs over 2-3 years |
| **C: Practice Academic** | PA-qualified faculty | ~7-10 hrs/week professional engagement |

### Two-Track Evaluation

| Track | What It Takes | Outcome |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| **Baseline** | Meet expectations in teaching, scholarship, and service | COLA eligibility |
| **Merit** | Achieve pre-negotiated SMART goal(s) beyond baseline | Rating of 4 or 5 |

---

## Guiding Principles

We built this framework on six principles:

1. **AACSB-Aligned** — Criteria reflect accreditation standards for faculty qualification
2. **Role-Appropriate** — Expectations vary by appointment type (SA vs. PA)
3. **Context-Sensitive** — Individual circumstances considered while maintaining standards
4. **Multi-Year Perspective** — Productivity assessed over 2-3 years, not annually
5. **Equity Across SBS** — Standards consistent with other departments
6. **Clear Distinction** — Baseline is distinguishable from merit-worthy achievement

## How ISOM Compares

Our approach balances clarity with flexibility:

| Aspect | Marketing | DPSHA | ISOM |
|--------|-----------|-------|------|
| Research Standard | 1 R&R or 2 presentations | "Sustained program" | 1-2 outputs over 2-3 years |
| Specificity | Highly quantitative | Highly qualitative | Clear targets + context |
| Pathway Diversity | Single standard | Multiple combinations | Three distinct pathways |

## Using This Framework

**For ISOM Faculty:**
1. Review the criteria at [harslan.github.io/isom-smart-goals](https://harslan.github.io/isom-smart-goals/)
2. Identify your primary scholarship pathway (A, B, or C)
3. Draft SMART goal(s) that exceed baseline expectations
4. Submit to Chair by December 31, 2025

**For Other Departments:**
Feel free to adapt this framework for your own context. We only ask that you credit ISOM if you find it useful.
